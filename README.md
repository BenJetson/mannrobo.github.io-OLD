This repository contains the website for our club.

Our awesome website is currently under construction,
which is to replace our not-so-nice site over at 
Google Sites [here](http://sites.greenvilleschools.us/mannrobotics).

## Hasn't this changed like 20 times already?!

We've been changing up how the site looks over the past few months. We initially hosted our site over at Google Sites, but we quickly grew tired of the limitations and the struggle to make the site look even half-decent. Then, we moved over to GitHub pages and started with a basic site based on Angular Material. Once we started to introduce posts, things got tricky, so we implemented Jekyll. Then, there is this branch, the Materialize CSS version. Ultimately, we decided that the Materialize CSS elements were more lightweight on the client and just in general look better than their Angular Material counterparts. However, some components underneath the surface may still use AngularJS to bind data.

## Need help?

Whether it's a general inquiry or a bug, you can [open a support ticket](https://github.com/mannrobo/mannrobo.github.io/issues/new) on our GitHub [issues page](https://github.com/mannrobo/mannrobo.github.io/issues).

Eventually, once the site is more established, we may integrate help into the site itself, but soon we'll have some basic documentation over at our [wiki](https://github.com/mannrobo/mannrobo.github.io/wiki).
